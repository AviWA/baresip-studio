This is a bare-bones <a href="https://github.com/baresip/baresip">baresip</a> based SIP User Agent application for Android.

Currently the application supports voice/video calling and messaging, UDP, TCP, TLS, and WSS signaling transports, voicemail Message Waiting Indication, incoming call transfers (REFER), PCMU/PCMA, iLBC, G.729, G.726, G.722, G.722.1, AMR, and Opus voice codecs, VP9, VP8, and H264 video codecs as well as ZRTP and (DTLS) SRTP media encapsulation.

Motivated by need for a secure SIP user agent for Android that does not depend on third party push notification services.

The application can be installed on Android devices running Android version 7.0 or later.  Video calling requires that Android device supports Camera 2 API at hardware Support Level 3 or FULL.
